Assignments for ml-class using python (numpy, scipy) rather than
octave. Intended to run in a python shell through python-mode.

Currently I have implemented from scratch
- linear regression
- logistic regression (but not multiclass using OvA)
- a neural net
- learning curves (train, cv, test sets) for training set size and lambda
- k-means

I have used sklearn's ML algorithms for
- svm
